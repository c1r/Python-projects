Assignment 2: Huffman

Included Files:
    * util.py
    * README

Accessories: None needed

Wiring Instructions: None needed

Running Instructions:
    1. Change directory to the one containing decompressor and/or compressor
       (in this case decompress.py and compress.py)
    2. Import util.py with the decompressor/compressor

Notes & Assumptions:
    1. util.py is to be imported by a compressor/decompressor
       (which derives the file to be compressed/decompressed) 
       and does do not do anything on its own
