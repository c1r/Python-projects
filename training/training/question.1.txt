I began with the theme of universe/space and selected words that are 
often used in space-related facts/sentences as pos features for the training set. 

"Space, planet, moon, galaxy, Earth", were some of the pos features for the 
training set. These words were chosen because they solely relate to
extraterrestrial objects. Some possible pos features such as 
"world, biggest, tallest", were not used because these are words 
used in other sectors/phases too.

The pos features are very crucial to approximate the required number 
of positive and negative instances, TPs and TNs, which steadily increases the
accuracy of the training set. Initially, with 20 positive and negatives instances
I obtained an accuracy of 0.63, which was improved by the addition of positive
TP (positive training instances containing pos features) and TN
(negative training instances not having any of the pos features)
