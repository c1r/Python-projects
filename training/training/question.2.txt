For task 3, the goal was to decrease accuracy and increase precision by not adding pos other pos features. 
By closely observing the formulae of Precision and Accuracy, we can see these values are directly proportional to TP 
(positive instances containing pos features) and the sum of TP and TN (negative instances
that do not have pos features),  respectively. Thus, the increase in precision
is greater than the increase of accuracy by the addition of a
TP instance. 
Training instances such as:
1. There is floating water in space
2. The footprints on the Moon will be there for 100 million years.
are some of the TP instances and that would increase our precision and accuracy slightly.

Furthermore, to decrease the Accuracy we must change a value that does 
not affect Precision. From the formulae, those are the TN and FP (positive 
training instances which do not contain pos features), but increasing TN
would also increase the overall accuracy as noted earlier. Therefore, we opt
to increase FP instances such as:
1. Neutron stars can spin 600 times per second
2. Pluto is named after the Roman god of the underworld
to decrease the accuracy below 0.65
